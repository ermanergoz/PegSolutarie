Peg solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. The standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole. A valid move is to jump a peg orthogonally over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg.   [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)
